## About
Using Python and Flask, the web app lets users sign up and login into their accounts where they can add or delete their own notes. The web app uses LoginManager for authentication and validates user info when signing up, while using SQLAlchemy for the database.

## Getting Started
In the project directory in Visual Studio Code, in the terminal type 'pip install flask flask-login flask-sqlalchemy' to install the required packages. Next, type 'python main.py' to run the app and go to the link given in the terminal to use the web app.
